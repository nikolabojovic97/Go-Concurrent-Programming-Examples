# Go-Concurrent-Programming-Examples

Some simple examples of concurrent programming in the Go programming language.<br>
I encourage everyone to try examples, make changes and compare results.

To run the examples, make sure that you have Golang installed on your computer.<br>
After that, run command <code>go run hello-world.go</code>.
